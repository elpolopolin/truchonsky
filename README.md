# Truchonsky ðŸ›’
Truchonsky is a test project built to emulate a basic e-commerce platform. It was developed using React for the frontend and Node.js with Express.js for the backend. This project allowed me to explore and implement essential features such as user authentication and Mercado Pago payment integration. It also served as a valuable learning experience in structuring a full-stack application from both client and server perspectives.
